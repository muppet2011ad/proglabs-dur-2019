***Interest of Content***

*Outstanding*

Content is interesting and seemingly original (we of course upvote good OC).

***Consistency of quality of visual presentation***

*Very good*

There are inconsistencies in the visual presentation between pages on the site - all articles have different conventions for headings and division of the page (e.g. subheadings). There are a couple of other elements that are unique to each page (e.g. the "by xxxxxx" section on page 2). Page 4's theming in particular is wildly inconsistent with the rest of the site, though makes up for it with a bizarre fly-in animation.

***Quality of written presentation***

*Perfect*

Running the pages through a spellchecker yielded no spelling mistakes and all text is easily readable against the background. As far as I can tell, there are no issues with determining what I'm trying to read.

***Validity of HTML***

*Perfect*

VSCode does not detect any errors in the HTML, nor are there any rendering issues that could indicate malformed HTML.

***Evidence of collaboration***

*Excellent*

* Author info is not written by the author of the page itself, satisfying this criteria.
* Contributions from members are slightly hard to gauge since work was done in multiple repositories then merged by Daniel via pull request. As such, I will assume (given that each person has contributed a page) that the contributions were sufficiently balanced.
* The page was being tweaked up until the start of peer review and pages were not ready to merge until yesterday evening. However, everything did come together and I don't think this has impacted negatively.
